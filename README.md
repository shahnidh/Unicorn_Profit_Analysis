# Unicorn E-commerce Sales Analysis

## Objective:

This mini-project is designed to integrate skills learned in SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau to analyze e-commerce sales data from Unicorn, a family-owned business. The primary goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help Unicorn identify weak areas and growth opportunities, ultimately aiding in business expansion and improvement. The project will culminate in a detailed report and presentation, showcasing the findings and recommendations.


## Project Overview:

Unicorn, an e-commerce platform, has experienced significant growth over the past two decades. As a small but rapidly expanding business, Unicorn’s owners are keen to leverage data analytics to drive further growth. This project involves analyzing a sample of Unicorn’s sales data from 2015 to 2018. The analysis aims to identify trends, weaknesses, and opportunities within the business, providing strategic insights to support future growth initiatives.

## Key Tasks:

**Data Exploration Using SQL:** The first part of the project involves exploring a sample database containing four tables of Unicorn’s sales data. Using SQL, the task is to answer predefined questions that will provide insights into the company’s performance during the years 2015-2018.

**Data Cleaning and Analysis Using Spreadsheets:** The second part involves working with a unified dataset in CSV format. The data will be cleaned and prepared for analysis using a spreadsheet. This step focuses on uncovering interesting insights, identifying trends, and visualizing key metrics that could influence Unicorn’s business strategies.

**Exploratory Data Analysis with Tableau:** In this phase, Tableau will be used to perform a deeper exploratory data analysis. The goal is to create dynamic dashboards that visualize the findings and provide a clear, interactive way for stakeholders to engage with the data. These dashboards will highlight unique insights and help in identifying areas for business optimization. Executive Summary and Presentation:

The final part of the project involves synthesizing the insights gained from SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau into a cohesive one-page report. This report will summarize the main findings and provide recommendations for the business.

## Key Findings Summary:

The analysis of Unicorn's sales data revealed the following insights:

**Regional Growth Opportunities:** The East and West regions show steady sales growth with high-profit margins, making them prime targets for further customer acquisition and retention efforts. The South region, though recovering, presents potential for untapped market growth, while the Central region struggles with negative profit margins, requiring cost and market trend analysis.

**Customer Segmentation:** The Consumer and Corporate segments are the main sales and profit drivers. Notably, the Consumer segment accounts for 50% of total sales, indicating strong performance across all product categories.

**Product Category Insights:** Office Supplies emerge as a high-margin, growth-potential category in the West region, especially within the Consumer and Corporate segments. Conversely, while Technology drives profits in the East, the Furniture category shows low profitability despite high sales.

**Customer Growth Strategy:** With 98.62% of sales coming from returning customers by Q4 2018, the focus should shift to new customer acquisition campaigns to unlock further market share.
